# It's Five O'Clock Somewhere

Small app that plays with the Rails 4.1.1 `travel_to` helper. Also makes me laugh, which always helps.

It tells you somewhere in the world where it's five o'clock, with accompanying photo hand-picked from Flickr. Neither big nor clever.

Oh, and drink responsibly, kids. And adults, too, I guess.
